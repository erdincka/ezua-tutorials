# EzUA Tutorials: Contributions Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the EzUA Tutorials repository, the official resource for the HPE Ezmeral
Unified Analytics Software (EzUA). This document provides guidance on how to contribute a new tutorial or resolve issues
in existing tutorials.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the Repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ezua-tutorials.git
    ```

1. Create a new feature branch to house your changes.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```

## Submitting Changes

1. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure that the tutorial runs as expected.
1. Commit your changes.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Introduce feature ..."
    ```

    > Note that each commit message should use the imperative mood. For example, use "Introduce feature x" rather than
      "This commit introduces feature x."

1. Rebase (if necessary) on top of the branch you're targeting. We strive to keep a linear commit history.
1. Push your branch to GitHub.

    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature-branch
    ```

1. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository.
1. Describe your changes in detail: why you made them, and any additional information that would help the reviewers.

## Style Guide

Please adhere to the following style guide for writing tutorials:

1. General notes:
    - Remove all outputs and metadata from Notebooks before committing to avoid versioning issues and repository bloat.
    - Use interactive elements in Notebooks to make the tutorial more engaging.
    - Create self-contained tutorials, without external dependencies on datasets.
    - Do not include large files in your commits. For example, if a dataset is too large consider hosting it elsewhere
      and pull it at runtime.
    - Include a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yaml` file specifying each dependency and its version.
1. Tutorial documentation:
    - Use Jupyter Notebooks for tutorials whenever possible. Even if you're running a Python script. You can use a
      Notebook to run the script and document what it does at the same time.
    - Include a README file explaining the tutorial's purpose and prerequisites. Add a feature image and a conceptual
      architecture diagram.
    - Avoid passive voice and use second person when writing tutorials.
    - Include proper citations and references.
1. Python style guide:
    - Follow the PEP-8 style [guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
    - Use docstrings and comments for code documentation.

## Review Process

One of the maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. You may be asked to make changes. You need
one approval to merge your PR. Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the target branch.
